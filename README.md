## Hi, I'm CarsonðŸ‘‹

### I'm a sophomore CS student @ the University of Utah with a minor in Advanced Financial Analysis 

## ðŸ’¼ Recent Projects
### project-towel
* During my internship at Pacific Avenue Capital Partners, I analyzed pricing strategy for Emerald Textiles (portfolio company, largest outsourced healthcare linen provider on west coast).
* Used Python + Cursor to crunch 700,000+ rows of invoice data on a yield basis ($/pound).
* Impact: Found 20Â¢+ yield differences between similar-sized customers. On millions of pounds, this meant $1.6M in missed EBITDA just from contracts renewing within a year. At a 10x multiple, that's $10M+ in Enterprise Value left on the table.

### project-treat
* While at Pacific Avenue, I helped diligence a live deal in exclusivity - a B2B software/hardware company serving restaurants.
* Built a data pipeline using Google Places API + Instagram scraping (Apify) to pull qualitative data on their entire customer base.
* First time using GCP/Google APIs - got it running same day, but my first run took 6+ hours for 9,000 records, so the next day I implemented async with 6 rotating API keys to process the list in under a minute.
* Key findings:
  * **Churn reality check:** 70% of churned customers still operational on Google (company claimed 50% churned due to closure). Red flag - customers leaving for competitors, not closing down.
  * **Customer concentration risk:** Top MRR customers were high-end restaurants ($100+ tickets, valet), but only 5% of total base fit this profile.
  * **No churn predictors:** Churned vs active customers showed identical field distributions (3% had valet, same price ranges, etc.) - no clear pattern to prevent/predict churn.

### Graph Data Structure Visualizer




## ðŸ”„ Currently Refactoring
* Most of these projects were built in Cursor under extreme time pressure. Now I'm going back to properly learn the underlying systems and expand the code. Follow along as I transform rapid prototypes into production-ready solutions.
