## Hi, I'm CarsonðŸ‘‹

### I'm a sophomore CS student @ the University of Utah with a minor in Advanced Financial Analysis

## ðŸ’¼ Recent Projects
### project-towel
* During my internship at Pacific Avenue Capital Partners, I analyzed pricing strategy for Emerald Textiles (portfolio company, largest outsourced healthcare linen provider on west coast).
* Used Python + Cursor to crunch 700,000+ rows of invoice data on a yield basis ($/pound).
* Impact: Found 10Â¢+ yield differences between similar-sized customers. On millions of pounds, this meant $1.6M in missed EBITDA just from contracts renewing within a year. At a 10x multiple, that's $10M+ in Enterprise Value left on the table.

## ðŸ”„ Currently Refactoring
* Most of these projects were built in Cursor under extreme time pressure. Now I'm going back to properly learn the underlying systems and expand the code. Following along as I transform rapid prototypes into production-ready solutions.
